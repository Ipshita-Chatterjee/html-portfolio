<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a second year student from ITER, SOA. I am studying my desired course in my current instituion. I am in pursuit for my Bachelor's 
  degree in Computer Science Engineering. I have secured a GPA of 9.01 in my first year and currently am in the process of refining
  my skills in my fields of interest. 
</p>

<p>The most enjoyable hobbies that I have include reading novels, listening to music, doing research work on personal and proffesional
  basis. I spend my time covering my course syllabus, writing research papers code for my professors. I read a lot of novels and write 
  articles on my own free time. I have my writing published in my school magazines.

<p>Amongst every changes I have faced starting from leaving my hometown to move into a foreign city to follow my passion and education, 
  to making new friends, taking every oppurtunity that knocks on my door and achieving all my wishes and ambitions, my personal favourite
  change is becoming my better self by navigating through the highs and low as an adult who will soon get the chance to live her independent
  life and help her family and support them and herself. I am extremely grateful to God for proving me with such oppurtunities, looking over
  me and guiding me through every moment of my life.
